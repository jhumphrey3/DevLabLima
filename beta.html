        The first thing I would do would be organizing the pages imagery,links, and colors.
         Sepearting each item into div cards with the information below the picture and all the user would have to do is click on the card and it would take them to the item they clicked on.
         Also I would make a decision on a color scheme that fit the page not just placing random colors all over the place.
         Establish a structure of what the page is, what the company is selling, and how much it costs?

         <img src="img/divcard.png" alt="divcard" width="1300" height="550">

         <p>

            The search bar would be next on the agenda. I would expand the search bar so it would be visible to the human eye not up in the corner on the right side mixed in with the clutter of the rest page.
            Then the search bar would find items on the page as opposed to before where the search bar is basically useless.</p><br>

            <img src="img/searchbar.png" alt="searchbar" width="1400" height="500">

            <p><br>

            Finaly I would fix the side nav bar on the left side organizing the links while also having an option on the page to translate to other languages specifically English.
            Know once someone clicks on the link it would take them to what there looking for as opposed to before where the user would click on a link and it would be broken.</p><br>
