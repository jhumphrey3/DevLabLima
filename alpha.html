        I came upon this website a couple of weeks ago surfing through the internet and I just had to choose this website because of all the flaws I saw in their design. 
        To start off the unorganized clutter throughout the entire page because the page isn't using grids to separate the graphics, content,links, and etc.
        The search bar is useless it doesnt locate the item you're looking for.
        The links on the sidenavbar on the left side are all broken. Click on one it takes you to a page that says "File could not be accessed".
        There is no navigational structure along with the fact the text is different sizes and the colors which in turn making the page hard to read and the page itself does not have a subject matter.
        Also dont click on a link because the picture right below the link the user clicks on either takes you to an item page that the user didn;t want to see or the links take the user to different websites in different languages.
